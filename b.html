<p id="mercury"> Mercury is the closest planet to the sun, but it is not the hottest planet. The sun shines 7 times hotter there than on Earth. Because Mercuryâ€™s thin atmosphere can not contain
    heat it is always freezing cold at night time. Mercury is named after the messenger to the Roman gods because it is the fastest moving planet. It takes 88 days for the planet to complete
    one orbit. Although Mercury orbits fast , it spins on its axis slowly. The impact craters that can are all over the planet were caused when asteroids crashed into the planet millions of
    years ago. The smooth part of the planet were formed when volcanic lava flooded those parts of Mercury. The craters on Mercury are named after writers, artists, and musicians. The crater
    Tolstoj is named after the Russian writer Leo Tolstoy. The Caloris Basin is one of the biggest crater in the solar system, 960 miles wide. Out of all of the planets Mercury is the smallest
    and even though it is smaller than the moon it weighs more because it is made up of materials like iron. A little more than 18 Mercurys can fit inside of the Earth.
